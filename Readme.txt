To use this program after putting in the command to run the program
you must put both a input text file and an output text file. After doing so you 
must put a flag with you desired use. You can use the -d flag if you are going 
from digits to words and the -l flag if you are going from words to digits. Not
following these will result in the code not working and a message will be output
that shows this and tells you what you are missing.
